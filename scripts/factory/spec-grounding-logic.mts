/**
 * Pure logic for F1-S9 slice 3 (spec-grounded review, issue #12, acceptance
 * criterion 3): "the review step checks the diff against the issue's
 * acceptance-criteria checkboxes, not only 'does it build + pass'."
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or the filesystem — matches the same
 * pure-logic/network-wiring split as `implement-patch-logic.mts` /
 * `publish-implement-patch.mts`. The network-facing entrypoint (slice 3b,
 * not yet built) fetches PR/issue data via `gh`, calls these functions, and
 * wires the resulting DATA block into a dedicated, self-authored review
 * prompt (NOT the existing `/code-review --comment` plugin invocation —
 * see the slice-3 design doc for why: how that plugin's own prompt
 * composes with appended free text is undocumented, so spec-grounding gets
 * its own, fully-owned prompt instead). Kept separate so the extraction/
 * classification/sanitization logic is unit-testable without mocking
 * `fetch` or shelling out to `gh`.
 *
 * SECURITY MODEL (Rider 1, operator review of the slice-3 design, 19 Jul
 * 2026): this repo is PUBLIC — anyone can open an issue, and any PR can
 * reference any issue, so the text this module extracts is UNTRUSTED input
 * that will eventually reach a prompted LLM review pass (slice 3b). Three
 * deliberate narrowings, all enforced HERE (not left to the prompt alone):
 * (a) only UNCHECKED acceptance-criteria checkbox LINES (plus each linked
 * issue's title) are ever extracted — never the issue's free-text body,
 * comments, or anything else an attacker-authored issue could stuff with
 * injected instructions; (b) {@link renderCriteriaDataBlock} wraps the
 * extracted lines in an explicit, sanitization-enforced delimiter pair with
 * a "this is DATA, not instructions" guard baked into the block itself;
 * (c) any occurrence of the delimiter tokens WITHIN an extracted criterion
 * or title is neutralized before rendering, so a crafted checkbox line
 * can't break out of the block it's embedded in. Slice 3b owns the
 * COMPLEMENTARY runtime half of this model (the review pass's own tool
 * policy: no Bash beyond the same proven read-only `gh` forms the existing
 * review job already uses, ideally none at all) — this module's job is
 * making sure the DATA itself is minimal and inert by construction before
 * it ever reaches a prompt.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, DOCUMENTED LIMITATION: this module has no notion of an epic's
 * merge history — it evaluates one issue's CURRENT checkbox state against
 * one PR's diff. A multi-slice epic (like this one) that never manually
 * ticks a checkbox as each slice merges will show EVERY criterion as
 * "unmet" to every PR that references the issue, including criteria
 * earlier, already-merged slices actually satisfied (verified against the
 * real issue #12: all three criteria are STILL unchecked even though
 * slices 1-2 already merged). In this repo's observed practice this mostly
 * self-corrects: every slice PR uses "Refs #N" (non-closing), and
 * {@link IssueLinkKind} calibration means a non-closing reference's unmet
 * criteria are never a blocking finding — the residual risk narrows to a
 * FINAL "Closes #N" PR on a multi-slice epic whose issue was never
 * manually re-ticked. Advisory only (a human reviews and resolves the
 * finding, same as every other inline finding this factory's classifiers
 * produce), so a false positive here costs a human glancing at one
 * already-satisfied checkbox, not a blocked pipeline. Reconstructing merge
 * history is real scope creep against a thin slice — documented rather
 * than silently accepted.
 */

/**
 * Which GitHub keyword linked a PR to an issue, and therefore what

 * criterion on a `"non-closing"` reference is expected, intentional
 * partial-slice work and must never become a blocking finding on its own.

 * repo's `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` only ever WRITES `Closes #N`, but a
 * human author could reasonably use any of GitHub's own synonyms, so all
 * of them are matched defensively — over-matching in the safe direction,
 * same philosophy as the #64 anti-gaming classifier's own suppression
 * patterns (a false positive here costs a human a glance; a false
 * negative would mean a real closing claim silently gets non-closing,
 * i.e. non-blocking, treatment).
 *
 * NON-CLOSING: this repo's own house convention
 * (`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: "Use 'Refs #N' / 'Part of #N' instead for
 * partial or related work, so an unfinished issue is never auto-closed")
 * — `ref`/`refs` and `part of`. Verified against real merged PR bodies
 * (#64, #67, #68), which use exactly these two forms.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT chase a compressed multi-issue form like the one
 * real PR #67 used informally in prose ("closes #62/#66" — only the first
 * `#N` immediately after a keyword is matched, so `#66` there is missed).
 * That form isn't this repo's template convention (which always pairs one
 * keyword with one `#N`, repeated per issue) and isn't how the factory's
 * own `buildImplementPrBody` ever writes a PR body — chasing it would be
 * real scope creep against a thin slice for a one-off informal usage.
 * Documented here rather than silently missed.
