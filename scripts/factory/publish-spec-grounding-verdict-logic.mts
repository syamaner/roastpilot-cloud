/**
 * Pure logic for the privileged `publish-spec-grounded-review` job (slice
 * 3b-iii, F1-S9, issue #12) — the ONLY piece of the spec-grounded review
 * pipeline that holds a writable GitHub token. Nothing here calls the
 * network; the network-facing entrypoint (`publish-spec-grounding-
 * verdict.mts`) computes inputs, calls these functions, and issues the
 * resulting API calls. Kept separate so the severity/comment decisions
 * (the security-relevant part) are unit-testable without mocking `fetch` —
 * the same split `apply-triage-verdict-logic.mts` already established for
 * the sibling triage pipeline.
 *
 * THE JOIN, and why `kind` is NEVER taken from the agent: the read-only
 * review agent (slice 3b-ii) contributes only `criterionId`, `satisfied`,
 * and `rationale` per finding — `validateSpecGroundingVerdict`
 * (`spec-grounding-verdict-schema.mts`) already REJECTS a finding that
 * tries to smuggle a `kind`/severity field outright. This module re-derives
 * `kind` deterministically by joining each finding back to the RUNNER's own
 * trusted `criteria-spine.json` (`spec-grounding-runner-logic.mts`'s
 * `buildCriteriaSpine`) by `criterionId` — so an agent that relabeled a
 * `closing` reference as `non-closing` in its own head (it can't even try,
 * since the field doesn't exist in its output schema) gains nothing; the
 * severity that actually gates a blocker comment is computed HERE, from
 * data the agent never touched.
 *
 * ALSO covers whole-issue escalation for an incompletely-reviewed closing
 * reference ({@link UnreviewedClosingIssueResult}, `spec-grounding-
 * runner-logic.mts`'s own `computeCriteriaSpineTruncation`) — a
 * closing-kind issue this PR referenced whose review is incomplete
 * (either it never got a single spine entry at all, or it got some but
 * not all of its own criteria), so there is no full per-criterion finding
 * set to join against. Team-lead's disposition (Codex finding, PR #76
 * review, L181, widened PR #82 round 2 review FOLD 1): this escalates
 * exactly like an unsatisfied criterion would, at the whole-issue level.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT include the blocker inline-comment builder or the
 * diff-anchor logic (a separate slice, 3b-iii-c — the novel mechanism
 * with its own real design risk, per team-lead's scope split) — this
 * module only produces the DATA those functions will consume
 * ({@link JoinedCriterionResult}s and {@link UnreviewedClosingIssueResult}s
 * with {@link deriveSeverity} `"blocker"`), plus the summary comment for
 * everything else.
